Working project examining BgDecimal functionality as well as Java io. 
Currently tracking high risk investment funds for capitol gains tax calculations. 
Plans to implement basic encryption in the future.

Tasks
-----

(2) Need to finish multitude of menu option functionality throughout the program. 
	Menu - option 2 needs to successfully print user
	Portfolio - option 3 needs to remove a specific object from the data structure
	LoginMenu - Need to be able to delete a user. Somehow.
	
(3) Not sure about the instantiation of Class FileObject. Portfolio objects have similar methods that exist in a dependant class and functionality seems smoother. Potentially rework the Login file instantition. Potentially create serializable objects to compare against? 
		
(4) Low priority until application is functional - implement Jsoup parser to update price objects / totals dynamically. This may be a bigger task than the learning purposes of this project though. 
		
(5) Internal class documentation could be better. Update comments, potentially add Javadoc
	
(6) Include some basic data encryption. Potentially beneficial learning exercise. 

I have learned why I should not embed to much logic into constructors
