Currently tracking high risk investment funds for capitol gains tax calculations. 
Plans to implement basic encryption in the future.

Tasks
-----
	
	(1) Portfolio line 21
		- Currently new users cannot be properly instantiated. Need selection structure to check if path 
		  exists for the object file. If not, this line will not run. 
		  
	(2) Need to finish multitude of menu option functionality throughout the program. 
	
	(3) Not sure about the instantiation of Class FileObject. Portfolio objects have similar methods that exist 
		in a dependant class and functionality seems smoother. Potentially rework the Login file instantition. 
		Potentially create serializable objects to compare against? 
		
	(4) Low priority until application is functional - implement Jsoup parser to update price objects / totals dynamically. 
		This may be a bigger task than the learning purposes of this project though. 
		
	(5) Internal class documentation could be better. Update comments, potentially add Javadoc
	
	(6) Include some basic data encryption. Potentially beneficial learning exercise.
